Note List<int[]> =new ArrayList<int[]>(); : Amazing trick when you working with with 2d arrays (when 2d arrays given in form int[][] given to you)
Arrays.sort(intervals, (arr1,arr2)-> Integer.compare(arr1[0],arr2[0])) : Another amazing line which will be useful while sorting 2D array

the compare(arr1[0],arr[0]) indicates by which element we want to sort.

When you run a political poll people confused if trying to search an answer or intentionally want to piss people off... and sometimes polls which are not political can get political . so she trying to explain how to keep things civil./ how to moderate

When people poll on a controversial topic - she had hard time figuring out whether person earnest or trying to start a drama. bad actor-someone who intentionally says things in order to cause conflict
 
group in general towards the left side- not fair moderation- when a person with different opinion show up-gets kicked out or bashed in the comments


Bias exists in the group regarding  answering polls,gpa example - will only answer if good gpa........ people will most likely take part in fun polls, nonsense shit. nobody wants to proudly say they have 2.4 gpa especially when there are people around who know you

Creator pissed off at polls which dosent make any sense eg do you have advice? yes or no =pointless questio
